# resistor.project

The tool detects resistors in an image and estimates their resistance values by identifying the color bands, using Python and OpenCV.

## Features

- Detects resistors from an image  
- Extracts and interprets color bands  
- Calculates resistance value based on standard color codes  
- Works with basic image inputs using OpenCV  

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  

## How It Works

1. Load an image containing a resistor  
2. Use OpenCV to preprocess the image  
3. Identify the resistor and isolate color bands  
4. Detect and map color bands to numeric values  
5. Calculate the total resistance using standard formulas  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy
### Run the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resistor-detector.git
cd resistor-detector
python main.py
